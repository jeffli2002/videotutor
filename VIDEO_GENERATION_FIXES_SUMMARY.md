# Video Generation Fixes Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ✅ Video Content Missing Complete Steps
**Problem**: Videos only showed title and concept, not the complete problem-solving steps
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `generateUniqueAnimationFromAI` to extract and use all steps from the solution
- Added fallback to use script pages when no steps are extracted
- Improved `buildUniqueManimScriptFromAI` to generate complete step-by-step content including:
  - Problem title
  - Formula introduction (for triangle area problems)
  - Given values extraction
  - Step-by-step calculations with both text descriptions and formulas
  - Final answer highlighting
- Added default calculation steps when extraction fails

### 2. ✅ Script Display at Bottom of Video
**Problem**: The script/subtitles were not showing at the bottom of the video page
**Solution**: The script display is already implemented in VideoGenerationDemo.jsx (lines 1949-1969). The issue was that the script data wasn't being populated correctly. This is now fixed with the improved step extraction.

### 3. ✅ Missing TTS Audio
**Problem**: Generated videos had no audio/TTS narration
**Solution**:
- Updated TTS endpoint configuration to use the kimi_api_server (port 3001) which has working Minimax TTS integration
- Modified `generateUniqueAnimationFromAI` to:
  - Generate TTS content from the extracted steps
  - Call TTS service to create audio
  - Merge audio with video using the merger service
  - Include audio path and hasAudio flag in the result
- Fixed TTS content generation to be synchronized with waterfall animation steps

## Key Code Changes

### 1. animationGenerator.js
- Lines 202-306: Enhanced `generateUniqueAnimationFromAI` with proper step extraction and TTS generation
- Lines 309-480: Improved `buildUniqueManimScriptFromAI` with complete waterfall script generation
- Lines 8-18: Updated TTS endpoint to use kimi_api_server (port 3001)

### 2. ttsService.js  
- Lines 5-8: Updated to use correct TTS endpoint from kimi_api_server

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
node test_video_generation_complete.js
```

This will test:
- Complete step extraction from solution
- Waterfall animation with all steps
- TTS audio generation
- Audio-video merging
- Script content population

## Expected Results

When generating a video for "求底边为8，高为6的三角形面积", the video should now include:
1. Title slide with the problem
2. Formula introduction (面积 = 底 × 高 ÷ 2)
3. Given values (底边 = 8, 高 = 6)
4. Step 1: Apply formula
5. Step 2: Substitute values (8 × 6 ÷ 2)
6. Step 3: Calculate product (48 ÷ 2)
7. Step 4: Final answer (24)
8. Synchronized TTS audio narration
9. Script display at the bottom of the video player
