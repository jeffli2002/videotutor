# Manim Server Status Report

## Current Status
- **Active Server**: stable_manim_server.py (Port 5001)
- **Status**: ✅ Working and stable
- **Purpose**: Generates consistent triangle area demonstration videos

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Mock Video Server
- ✅ Removed simple_manim_server.py which was using mock/placeholder videos
- ✅ Updated animationGenerator.js to use port 5001

### 2. Fixed TTS System
- ✅ Implemented Azure Cognitive Services Speech for real TTS
- ✅ Azure TTS is now primary with fallbacks
- ✅ Generates real Chinese and English audio files
- ✅ Fixed audio/video merger ES module issues

### 3. Video Generation Improvements
- ✅ Removed fallback placeholder videos
- ✅ Fixed video loading retry mechanism
- ✅ Added smooth fade-in animations
- ✅ Video only plays when user clicks play button

### 4. Manim Server Options

#### stable_manim_server.py (Currently Active)
- **Pros**: Always works, never fails
- **Cons**: Limited to triangle area demonstrations
- **Use Case**: Production stability

#### real_manim_video_server.py (Enhanced)
- **Pros**: Generates unique videos for each math problem
- **Cons**: Some encoding issues with complex scripts
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Better error logging
  - Language detection for Chinese/English
  - Safe fallback script generation
  - Improved LaTeX handling

## Next Steps
To use the enhanced real_manim_video_server.py:

1. Fix remaining issues:
   - Variable scoping in generated scripts
   - LaTeX encoding for Chinese characters
   - Raw string formatting for fractions

2. Test thoroughly with various math problems

3. Consider a hybrid approach:
   - Use stable_manim_server.py as fallback
   - Try real_manim_video_server.py first
   - Fall back if generation fails

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test stable server
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/render -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"Triangle area","output_name":"test1"}'

# Test TTS
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/tts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello world","voice":"female","language":"en"}'

# Test audio/video merger
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/merge -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"video_path":"/rendered_videos/test.mp4","audio_path":"/audios/test.mp3"}'
```
