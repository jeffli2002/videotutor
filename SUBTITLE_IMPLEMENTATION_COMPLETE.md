# Subtitle Implementation Complete

## Summary
Subtitles have been successfully implemented in the VideoTutor system. All generated videos now display synchronized subtitles at the bottom of the screen.

## What Was Changed

### 1. AI-Driven Manim Generator (`src/services/aiDrivenManimGenerator.js`)
- Modified `generateWaterfallManimScript()` to include subtitle functionality:
  - Added black semi-transparent subtitle background bar at bottom of screen
  - Synchronized subtitle text with content animations
  - Subtitle text updates as each new content item is displayed
  - Supports both Chinese and English text with appropriate fonts

- Updated `generateBasicManimScript()` fallback to also include subtitles

### 2. Implementation Details
- **Subtitle Background**: Black rectangle with 70% opacity at bottom of screen
- **Text Style**: White text, 20pt font size for readability
- **Font Support**: 
  - Chinese: SimHei, Noto Sans CJK SC, WenQuanYi Micro Hei, Microsoft YaHei
  - English: Arial
- **Synchronization**: Subtitles change with each content transition
- **Text Length**: Long subtitles are truncated to 60 characters with "..."

## How It Works

1. The AI generates `scripts_data` containing narration text for each step
2. During video rendering, each script item is displayed as a subtitle
3. Subtitles transition smoothly (0.3s fade) when content changes
4. Remaining subtitles are shown at 2-second intervals at the end

## Testing
Created `test_subtitle_functionality.js` to verify:
- Subtitle elements are present in generated scripts
- Both Chinese and English subtitles work correctly
- Scripts contain proper subtitle synchronization logic

## Visual Result
Videos now show:
- Mathematical content in the main area
- Black subtitle bar at the bottom
- White subtitle text that changes with the narration
- Smooth transitions between subtitles

## No Additional Services Required
The implementation is entirely within the Manim script generation, requiring no changes to:
- TTS service
- Manim server  
- Audio-video merger
- Frontend

All existing videos will automatically get subtitles when regenerated.
