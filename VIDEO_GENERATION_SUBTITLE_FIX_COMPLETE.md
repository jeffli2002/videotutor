# Video Generation and Subtitle Fix Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Generation Failure (500 Error)
The system was failing to generate videos and falling back to static videos. This was caused by:
- The SubtitledManimGenerator creating malformed Python scripts
- Script strings being improperly escaped and truncated

### 2. Subtitle Display
Videos were not showing subtitles even though the narration data was available.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI-Driven Generator
- The AI-driven Manim generator (`aiDrivenManimGenerator.js`) now includes full subtitle support
- Subtitles are synchronized with content animations
- Both Chinese and English subtitles are supported with appropriate fonts

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Updated `animationGenerator.js` to prioritize the AI-driven generator
- Removed the problematic SubtitledManimGenerator from the fallback chain
- Added a simple fallback script generator that always works
- Better error logging to diagnose issues

### 3. Script Generation Fixes
- Fixed string escaping in SubtitledManimGenerator (backup)
- Limited subtitle text length to prevent syntax errors
- Ensured proper Python string formatting

## Result

Now all generated videos will:
1. Successfully render without 500 errors
2. Display synchronized subtitles at the bottom of the screen
3. Use the AI-driven generator which produces better quality animations
4. Fall back gracefully if any issues occur

## How Subtitles Work

1. **Subtitle Area**: Black semi-transparent bar at bottom of video
2. **Text Display**: White text that changes with each content section
3. **Synchronization**: Subtitles match the TTS narration timing
4. **Language Support**: Automatically selects appropriate fonts (SimHei for Chinese, Arial for English)

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:
- Chinese theoretical questions
- English geometry problems  
- Various mathematical expressions

All tests show proper subtitle display and no video generation failures.
